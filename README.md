# PQC Hash Key Generator (SHA-256)

This project implements a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) style hashing 
function using SHA-256. It is designed to work with QKD (Quantum Key 
Distribution) generated keys.

## Features
- Input QKD key
- Generates secure PQC SHA-256 hash
- Clean Python implementation

## Run the Program
